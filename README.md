# Grade 3 Math Test WhatsApp

This is a simple React web app for a Grade 3 math test.
After completing the test, the student fills in *mom's WhatsApp number*, and sends the result using a WhatsApp "click to chat" link — **no backend, no Twilio, no APIs required**!

## How it works

1. The student answers multiple-choice questions.
2. Enters mother's WhatsApp number (with country code, e.g. +919876543210).
3. Submits the test.
4. Clicks the provided link to send the result directly in WhatsApp.
